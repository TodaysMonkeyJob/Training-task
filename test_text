Knowledge graph
Quite a lot of information there! We have text, tons of hyperlinks, and even an audio clip. That’s a lot of relevant
and potentially useful information on a single page. The possibilities of putting this into a use case are endless.
However, there is a slight problem. This is not an ideal source of data to feed to our machines. Not in its current
form anyway. Can we find a way to make this text data readable for machines? Essentially, can we transform this text
data into something that can be used by the machines and also can be interpreted easily by us? Yes, we can! We can do
it with the help of Knowledge Graphs (KG), one of the most fascinating concepts in data science. I have been blown
away by the sheer potential and applications of knowledge graphs and I am sure you will as well. In this article, you
will learn what knowledge graphs are, why they’re useful, and then we’ll dive into code by building our own knowledge
graph on Wikipedia data to discover structured information and relationaships.
